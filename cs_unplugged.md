# Teaching CS without a Computer

## About

Despite the name - Computer Science is **not** just about computers!
This means that CS concepts can be taught without the use of computers, perhaps when you don't have access to a computer lab or when you are teaching students without the ICT skills needed for programming.

**Unplugged** methods have been a popular way to introduce Computational Thinking. 
In this activity, we will work through 2 different examples of this approach: *Computer Science Unplugged* and *My Robotic Friends*.

The presentation (as a PDF file) can be downloaded [here](cs_unplugged_presentation.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

## Computer Science Unplugged

Computer Science Unplugged (or CSUnplugged for short) is a collection of free activities that teach Computational Thinking. 
In this activity we will work through the [Binary Numbers](http://csunplugged.org/binary-numbers/){:target="_blank"} and [Image Representation](http://csunplugged.org/image-representation/){:target="_blank"} resources.

The worksheet for the CSUnplugged part of this activity can be downloaded [here](cs_unplugged_worksheet.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

The original version of these activities and many other similar activities are available on the [CSUnplugged website](http://csunplugged.org/){:target="_blank"}. 
This [website](http://www.mrmaynard.com/activities/binarycards/){:target="_blank"} has an interactive version of the cards and automatically shows the conversion between binary and decimal numbers.

## My Robotic Friends

My Robotic Friends is an unplugged activity developed by [Thinkersmith](http://thinkersmith.org/){:target="_blank"}.
In this activity some students (the "programmers") write instructions for other students, who act like robots, to follow in order to build a stack of cups.

The worksheet for this activity can be downloaded [here](robotic_friends_worksheet.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

The original version of the activity is available for download [here](https://csedweek.org/unplugged/thinkersmith){:target="_blank"}. 
This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaW3PAzHxCU){:target="_blank"} shows some examples of the activity in action.
